Work in progress, 3D Game Engine with OpenGL and DirectX.

Used Windows SDK Version 10.0.15063.0

Extract Dependencies.rar into the Engine Folder

The structure should look like this

-> Subayaku-Game-Engine\Engine\
      -> Source
      -> Dependencies
      -> ..
     
Set to x64 and Release for best performance. And set the Sandbox project as your start project.

On the first start it will crash because DLL's are missing. Copy the DLL's from the Dependencies\Dlls Folder into 
your Builds Folder.
